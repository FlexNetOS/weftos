description: Use the MemPalace MCP server for persistent cross-session memory of decisions, conversations, and learnings. The palace lives at ~/.mempalace/ (per-user, not per-repo) and exposes 9 MCP tools — search, add_drawer, list_wings, list_rooms, get_taxonomy, check_duplicate, delete_drawer, reconnect, status. Reach for this skill BEFORE asking the user to re-explain something they already told you, AFTER making a non-obvious decision worth remembering, or when you need verbatim recall of past conversations.

# MemPalace Usage — WeftOS

## What it is

MemPalace is a local-first AI memory store. It saves verbatim text,
indexes it with sentence-transformer embeddings stored in ChromaDB, and
exposes search/store/list operations over MCP. **Nothing leaves the
local box** — no API keys, no cloud calls. The palace itself lives at
`~/.mempalace/` (per-user, cross-project).

The data model: **wings** (people / projects) → **rooms** (topics,
drawn from folder structure) → **drawers** (verbatim content). Searches
can be scoped to a wing or room, or run flat across the whole palace.

## When to reach for MemPalace (vs. GitNexus / Understand-Anything)

| Question type | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "What did we decide about X last week?" | **MemPalace** `search` | Verbatim conversation history with semantic recall |
| "What's the call graph for `fn foo`?" | GitNexus `impact` | Structural code-graph traversal |
| "What does this crate do?" | Understand-Anything `/understand-onboard` | LLM-assembled comprehension graph |
| "Why was this pattern chosen?" | **MemPalace** `search` first, then GitNexus `context` | Memory captures intent, GitNexus captures structure |
| "Has this been discussed before?" | **MemPalace** `check_duplicate` | Pre-commit dedup against existing memories |

The three tools are **complementary**: GitNexus = structure, Understand-Anything = comprehension, MemPalace = history/intent. An ideal pre-edit pass queries all three.

## Install

```bash
scripts/install-mempalace.sh
```

This is idempotent. It:
1. Verifies Python 3.9+ is on PATH.
2. `pip install --user mempalace` (or `pipx install` if pipx is around).
3. `mempalace init "$REPO_ROOT"` — scans this repo, derives rooms from
   folder layout, ensures `~/.mempalace/` exists.
4. Surfaces the Claude Code plugin install command if `claude` is on PATH.

Mining (importing source/docs into the palace) is **OFF by default**.
For weftos's ~40 crates + `weft` daemon + `weaver` it's typically a
1–3 minute pass. Opt in:

```bash
mempalace mine "$(pwd)"                                  # code + docs
mempalace mine "$(pwd)" --mode convos                    # conversation exports
mempalace mine ~/chats/ --mode convos --extract general  # auto-classify
```

## MCP tool list (Claude Code, codex, etc.)

```
mempalace_status            — palace health, total drawers, wing/room breakdown
mempalace_list_wings        — list all wings + drawer counts
mempalace_list_rooms        — rooms within a wing
mempalace_get_taxonomy      — full wing → room → count tree
mempalace_search            — semantic search; optional wing/room filter
mempalace_check_duplicate   — check before filing a drawer (dedup pass)
mempalace_add_drawer        — file verbatim content into a wing/room
mempalace_delete_drawer     — remove a drawer by ID
mempalace_reconnect         — invalidate cache after external writes
```

(Some marketing pages claim 19 or 29 tools — the actual MCP server source is
9. Verified against `mempalace/mcp_server.py` on the develop branch.)

### Recommended pre-edit pattern

```
1. mempalace_search    "<task summary>"          # has anyone done this before?
2. gitnexus.context    <symbol>                  # structural neighborhood
3. /understand-explain <symbol>                  # comprehension layer
4. (do the work — via scripts/build.sh per CLAUDE.md mandate)
5. mempalace_add_drawer  wing=weftos room=<topic> content=<decision + rationale>
```

## Storage location & scope

| Path | Contents | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.mempalace/` | Palace database (ChromaDB + SQLite) | **Per-user.** Never committed; cross-project. |
| `~/.mempalace/config.yaml` | User config | Per-user. |
| In-repo state | _none_ | MemPalace does **not** write into the repo. |

Multiple repos share one palace by design — that's how agents remember
the cross-cutting context that spans repos (e.g., a decision made while
working on `weftos` also matters when you switch to `ruvector` next
week).

## When NOT to use MemPalace

- For **code-structure queries** ("where is X called from?", "rename Foo")
  — use **GitNexus**. MemPalace stores conversational memory, not AST.
- For **fresh-codebase comprehension** ("what does this crate do?") —
  use **Understand-Anything** `/understand-onboard <crate>`. MemPalace
  is empty on first run; it's only useful once the palace has history.
- For **secrets, credentials, PII**. MemPalace stores verbatim — never
  pass raw API keys, customer data, or anything that would harm someone
  if leaked locally.
- For **build/test/lint operations** — those go through `scripts/build.sh`
  per `CLAUDE.md` lines 43–47, not through MemPalace.

## Repo-specific notes

- **`gui/src-tauri/`** is excluded from the cargo workspace and from
  `.gitnexusignore`. `mempalace mine` walks the filesystem, so it WILL
  pick up the Tauri shell unless you pass `--exclude gui/src-tauri/`
  or maintain a `.mempalace_ignore` file. For most cross-repo agent
  work, including the Tauri shell is fine — it's a small fraction of
  the total drawer count.
- **`scripts/build.sh` mandate**: every build/test/check/lint operation
  goes through `scripts/build.sh`. MemPalace doesn't override this —
  it just remembers conversational context, not build state.
- **Naming taxonomy**: when filing drawers, prefer wing-name `weftos`
  even though crates are named `clawft-*`. Searches against `weftos`
  catch decisions about both layers; searches against `clawft-*` only
  catch crate-internal details.

## Smoke test

```bash
mempalace status          # confirms palace exists + connected
mempalace list-wings      # shows the wing for this repo
mempalace search "test"   # semantic search smoke test
```

If any of these error with `palace not initialized`, re-run
`scripts/install-mempalace.sh`.
